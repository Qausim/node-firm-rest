# node-firm-rest

I have been learning to write Restful APIs in NodeJS and as a believer in the
ideology that practise brings professionalism I try to create projects even if
simple to validate my learning, this is one of such. This project mimicks the
employee records of an organization using technologies like NodeJS and PostgreSQL.
